#What is String =>Strings are key to communicating with a user and programming.
#Literal forms =>he interpreter treats anything surrounded with single quotes (') or double quotes(") as a string. In other words, both 'RubyMonk' and "RubyMonk" will create instances of strings. 
#String Length => return the length of the string 'RubyMonk'. 

puts"Lesson 4"
puts"RubyMonk"
puts "RubyMonk".length


#String Interpolation Do remember that placeholders aren't just variables. Any valid block of Ruby code you place inside #{} will be evaluated and inserted at that location
